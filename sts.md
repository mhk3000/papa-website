# Leader of the martyrs  Marasiya  mourn poetry

Marsiya is poetry which express sorrow over the suffering of family of prophet Mohammed ( peace be on him ). Prophet family was persecuted after his death and it started almost immediately and continued for a century  or so , and it reached its highest point of suffering in the martyrdom of Karbala , Iraq , when his grand son imam Hussain A.S. was martyred with 72 of his family which included 18 of  the family of the prophet ( peace be on him ).  Aashura is the 10th of Mohrrum ( 1st month of Islaminc calender and it fell on 26th Dec 2009, this year ) when Hussain imam AS was martyred in Karbala after three days of thirst and hunger about 60 years of establishment of   Islam in the  world.
This literature is developed especially  after the martyrdom of Kerbala and people over the centuries written marasiya not only in Arabic but many languages like Persian, Urdu, Pashtu, many Indian local language, etc.  Though Hussein imam is central to the marasiya  but slowly it included suffering of Ali, Faema and Hasan , other holy members of Panjetan and progeny of Hussein imam, his son Zain el Abedeen.  It started with the shia branch of Islam and  then by other Muslims and so much so that people of other religions like Hindus and Christian    ( Arabs ) also joined.  Underlined them is love for the family of prophet ( peace be on him ) and deep sense of grief  at their suffering by the rulers of the time.

This was written by  51 st  dai el mutlaq  of Dawood Bohra , late  ( muqaddas ) Syedna Taher Saifuddin in Arabic . Its explanation was given in lisan e dawat (which  is mixture of Arabic,  Indian local language Gujarati , Urdu and other dialects of Gujarat state of India .)  From this I have tried to put in English.  My attempts contains many error and omission and for that I seek forgiveness of God .  However, in  case , some way if it fills the heart of reader with the pain and remind him the suffering of the martyrs of Karbala  and tear comes out from his/her  eyes ,  I will be very happy and thankful to God and credit will  belong entirely to my leader Syedna Taher Saifuddin maula ( muqaddas).
